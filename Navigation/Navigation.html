	<h4>For the curious:</h4>
	<p>First, an occupancy grid (gray) is calculated from a provided list of polygons and circles (tan). When a destination is chosen, an A* search (the heuristic being the cost to the goal without occupied cells) goes through the grid using 8 actions (north, north-east, east, etc.) while keeping into account the size of the robot on the grid. The path is then "smoothed" using gradient descent, which results in something like tightening a rope. The line following uses a "virtual" line sensor that surrounds the robot in a small circle. The error used in line following (only PD since the I term is set to 0) is the difference between the heading of the robot and direction to where the path intersects the circular line sensor. That intersection point is shown as a red dot. For differential drive, the PD error linearly translates directly to left/right motor values. <br/> View the source for details.</p>
